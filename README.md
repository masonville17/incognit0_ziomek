### (ziomek translates directly to compatriot in Polish.)


Incognit0_ziomek is intended to circumvent the tiktok ban in a way that doesnt require you to modify your own phone.



You will be able to access it over VNC (virtual network client), which means you should be able to use it directly on your ios, windows, linux, or android device (once we get the touch screen over VNC all smoothed over)

Incognit0_ziomek may directly include a split-tunnel vpn in the future, to make ip location tracking easier for folks, otherwise just connect your computer to VPN connection of your choice and run it manually (note this still requires split-tunneling)

Incognit0_ziomek is good for a quick, persisted, and simple android virtualization experience or for testing purposes.
